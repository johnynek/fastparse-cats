# fastparse-cats

Cats instances for fastparse parsers.

This gives you a lawful Monad and Alternative for fastparse Parsers. This allows you to easily
reuse generic functions from cats with fastparse.

This is in an early state. The code works and passes the laws, but it only supports the String
parsers and has not been published yet.
